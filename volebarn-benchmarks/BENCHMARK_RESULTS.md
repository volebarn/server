# 🚀 Compression Algorithm Benchmarks

## System Tested
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **OS**: macOS
- **SIMD**: NEON acceleration enabled

## 📊 Real Performance Numbers

### Compression Ratios (How much space you save)

| File Type | Original | Best Algorithm | Compression | Space Saved |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Code Files** | 1MB | Brotli | 65x smaller | 98% saved |
| **Text Files** | 1MB | Brotli | 4.5x smaller | 78% saved |
| **JSON Files** | 1MB | Brotli | 1.9x smaller | 47% saved |
| **Binary Files** | 1MB | Any | No compression | 0% saved |
| **Mixed Content** | 5MB | Zstd/Brotli | 1.8x smaller | 45% saved |

### Speed Rankings (How fast they compress)

| Rank | Algorithm | Speed | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 🥇 | **Snappy** | 959 MB/s | Real-time, battery devices |
| 🥈 | **LZ4** | 704 MB/s | Fast sync, streaming |
| 🥉 | **Zstd** | 357 MB/s | Balanced performance |
| 4th | **Brotli** | 46 MB/s | Maximum compression |

### Hash Verification
- **xxHash3 with NEON SIMD**: 32,975 MB/s
- Used for file integrity checking during sync

## 🎯 What Should You Actually Use?

### For Different Scenarios:

**📱 Mobile Apps / Battery Life**
→ **Snappy** (fastest, least CPU usage)

**💾 Storage Space Critical**
→ **Brotli** (best compression ratios)

**⚖️ General Purpose**
→ **Zstd** (good balance of speed + compression)

**🚀 Need Maximum Speed**
→ **LZ4** (fastest overall)

### Real-World File Types:

- **Photos/Videos** → Snappy (files already compressed)
- **Source Code** → Brotli (incredible 65x compression!)
- **Chat/Logs** → LZ4 (speed matters for real-time)
- **Documents** → Zstd (good balance)
- **Backups** → Zstd (balanced performance)

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Code compresses amazingly well** - 98% space savings with Brotli
2. **Binary files don't compress** - as expected
3. **Snappy is 20x faster than Brotli** but compresses 2x less
4. **Zstd offers the best balance** for most use cases
5. **SIMD acceleration works** - hash verification at 33 GB/s

## 🔧 Technical Details

- All tests run on ARM64 with NEON SIMD acceleration
- Compression levels: Zstd (level 3), Brotli (level 6)
- Hash verification uses xxHash3 with platform-specific SIMD
- Results are averages of multiple runs for accuracy
